## Miscellanious

- Exodus is inspired by the Edgenuity Bot world. I was first made aware of Edgenuity Bots when I was in school, not wanting to manually lookup answers on Brainly. I found a community full of students like me, and I saw a place to hang out, chat, and all while having my work done in the background by the same program I was in a discord of. Before Edgenuity, I valued education heavily, and I still do. Please, do not use or purchase automation bots like these. Things you learn, even on online school has a real impact on the real world and your real world knowledge. After Edgenuity, in College, or in real-life classes, you'll be behind and will ultimately end up trapped even more than you were before cheating. Unfortunately, due to Edgenuity Bots, I ended up with an low (for me) SAT score, and I attribute it entirely to cheating in school. I would strongly recommend to do the smart thing and learn, but there must always be an alternative or escape from any bad situation you are in. Irregardless of the world we live in or attempts at patching cheating, Public (High) School students will always find a workaround to cheat. To me, I see this as kind of innevitable.
